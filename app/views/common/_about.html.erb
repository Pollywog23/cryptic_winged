Is it the genetic competitive way of females that makes Botox a necessity? Is it the insecurity of our own mind that makes us want to be someone we are not? Is it money that makes one beautiful and flawless to the eyes? It is natural law to watch our own body decay w age. Either it's accepted or altered... tricking the eyes into seeing a timeless beauty is not genuine but man made.... If we were all blind or FACELESS, who would be voted the most beautiful Girl in the world? MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL... A Faceless World To Them All-- Blind Beauty...
